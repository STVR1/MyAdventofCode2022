 Description
 </h2>
 <h4>
 <p align="justify">Here you can see my codes, which were written by me during Advent-of-Code 2022.
 <p align="justify">The main objective is to complete 25 days.
 <p align="justify">More correctly:
 <p align="justify">Every day consists of 2 parts. When you complete the first part, you get an access to the second part. 
 In both parts you have a task. It's to make a code for work with information in file. As I understood, you can make codes on any programming language (for my example it's C++). When you have made a code, you get an answer, according with your txt file, and check it, if it is the right answer. If it is true, you get an access to the second part, else find the mistake :). After completing the day you get stars and draw the Christmas tree.

 Should I do it?

 Of course. You practise your skills and make them stronger. So don't lose your great opportunity.
